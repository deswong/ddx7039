.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBspeaker\-test\fP generates a tone that can be used to test the speakers of a computer.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-c\fP | \fB\-\-channels\fP \fINUM\fP
\fINUM\fP channels in stream

.TP
\fB\-D\fP | \fB\-\-device\fP \fINAME\fP
PCM device name \fINAME\fP

.TP
\fB\-f\fP | \fB\-\-frequency\fP \fIFREQ\fP
sine wave of \fIFREQ\fP Hz

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fP
Print usage help

.TP
\fB\-p\fP | \fB\-\-period\fP \fITIME\fP
period size of \fITIME\fP microseconds

.TP
\fB\-r\fP | \fB\-\-rate\fP \fIRATE\fP
stream of \fIRATE\fP Hz

.TP
\fB\-t\fP | \fB\-\-test\fP \fB1\fP|\fB2\fP
-t1 means use pink noise (default).

Pink noise is perceptually uniform noise - that is, it sounds like every frequency at once.  If you can hear any tone it may indicate resonances in your speaker system or room.

-t2 means use sine wave.

.TP
\fB\-s\fP | \fB\-\-speaker\fP \fB1\fP|\fB2\fP
Test speaker 1 or speaker 2 only, rather than both

.SH USAGE EXAMPLES

Produce stereo sound from one stereo jack:
.EX
  speaker-test -Dplug:front -c2
.EE

Produce 4 speaker sound from two stereo jacks:
.EX
  speaker-test -Dplug:surround40 -c4
.EE

Produce 5.1 speaker sound from three stereo jacks:
.EX
  speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6
.EE

To send a nice low 75Hz tone to the Woofer and then exit without touching any other speakers:
.EX
  speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6 -s1 -f75
.EE

.SH AUTHOR
The speaker-test program was written by James Courtier-Dutton.
Pink noise support was added by Nathan Hurst.
